      <h1>ICELAND</h1>
      <p>Iceland, a Nordic island nation, is defined by its dramatic landscape with volcanoes, geysers, hot springs and lava fields. Massive glaciers are protected in Vatnajökull and Snæfellsjökull national parks. Most of the population lives in the capital, Reykjavik, which runs on geothermal power and is home to the National and Saga museums, tracing Iceland’s Viking history.</p>

        <p>The northern lights, also known as the aurora borealis, are the visible result of solar particles entering the Earth’s magnetic field and ionizing high in the atmosphere. The ionization gives them their colors, usually green, but occasionally purple, red, pink, orange, and blue.</p>

        <p>Home to Iceland's highest peak, Hvannadalshjukur, and hiding some potential volcanoes under its ice cap, the enormous Vatnajökull is known as ‘the water glacier’ and deserves first place on your bucket list! With an area of 8,100 km2 (3,100 sq mi), Vatnajökull, Europe's largest icecap, covers 8% of Iceland’s total land. As a comparison, this is close to the size of the islands of Corsica or Cyprus. The average thickness of Vatnajökull’s ice is 400 m (1,300 ft), with a maximum thickness of 1,000 m (3,300 ft).</p>
