      <p>A glacier walk is a great way to experience Icelandic nature and a tour to Sólheimajökull glacier is an ideal way to spend the day. On the two-hour drive from Reykjavík, you will pass right under the famous Eyjafjallajökull volcano that caused so much trouble in the spring of 2010.<br><br>Just east of the volcano lies Sólheimajökull, an outlet glacier from Mýrdalsjökull, Iceland’s fourth-largest glacier. There, we will guide you on a safe and easy Glacier Walk on crampons up onto the icy landscape.<br><br>As we explore the wonderland of ice sculptures, ridges, and deep crevasses, you will learn about these disappearing giants. Our experienced mountain guides will teach you how to use the basic glacier equipment necessary for this tour. This tour also gives the opportunity to enjoy the picturesque waterfalls, Skógafoss and Seljalandsfoss.<br><br>If you have your own car and want to meet us on location, check our tours from Sólheimajökull.<br><br> We always recommend to book as soon as you are ready especially if you have a strict travel schedule or a large group. It is easy to change or cancel 24 hours before departure by emailing us (info@mountainguides.is). Tours can also be purchased on the day of the activity as long as there are spaces available.</p>
